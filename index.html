        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      </a>
      <p>Based in Glasgow, I am a friendly and enthusiastic person looking for employment. With a wide variety of proffessional experience, I am adaptable and open to any opportunity. I am looking to secure a permanent position in a role that combines technical skill and working closely with other people. Outside of work, I enjoy learning new things and exploring new places. Having recently started on Scotland's Munros, I have climbed 9 so far - only 273 to go!

      <h2>Career History</h2>
      <p>Graduating with a First Class BSc in Physics from the University of Strathclyde, I joined the Operations Management graduate scheme at Rolls-Royce, which delivered an incredible breadth of experience. In spring 2018, I continued on to the Operations Management leadership programme and returned to Glasgow to continue my career in managing operations and leading people. At Rolls-Royce, I was sponsored to become a STEM ambassador. In my first year in this role (alongside my regular job) I led a team of graduates to deliver a Physics in Action workshop to local secondary schools. Since then, I have supported and led dozens of events, from afternoon-sessions for one class through to a week-long activity camp for all the primary schools in Derbyshire. I regularly hosted site-visits for schools at the Inchinnan facility, tailoring tours to each group of students depending on age, interests and career aspirations. In time, I realised this was consistently one of my favourite parts of every role and in 2020 I left Rolls-Royce to embark on teacher training. While I enjoyed studying a social science for the first time, the lesson planning and practical placements showed me that classroom teaching was not the path I want to pursue. My current CV will give more detail on my work history and career goals.</p>
